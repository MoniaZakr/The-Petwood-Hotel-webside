            <i class="heading">One of the best gardens to visit in Lincolnshire</i>
            <p class="text">Planned and executed according to Lady Grace Weigallâ€™s lavish tastes by famous landscape designer Harold Peto, the gardens at the Petwood are open to the public all year. Each season has its beauty, but they are especially impressive in spring and summer when the colours are at their most intense. A leisurely stroll to absorb the ambiance of the quiet lawns, vibrant flowers and elegant features is a must in all but the most inhospitable of English weather. During the warmer months we also host various outdoor events, including outdoor theatre and the famous Woodhall Spa 1940s festival.</p>

            <i class="heading">From woodland walks to al fresco dining </i>
            <p class="text">Perhaps the most striking feature for garden visitors today is the rhododendron walk, which bursts with colour in the late spring and delights today's guests as much as those invited to Lady Weigall's garden parties. Thirty acres of woodlands provide pleasant short walks in the grounds and a gentle stroll is a very civilized way to follow breakfast. The beauty of the place is matched by its quiet poignancy too, with tributes to past lives from those taken by war to the late Princess Diana.</p>
            <p class="text">With so many quiet corners and surprises to find, there is always something pretty or thought-provoking to spot in the gardens. One of our Classic English Afternoon Teas on the terrace is a sublime option on a warm afternoon, affording fine views and pure relaxation. Alternatively, guests of all ages will enjoy a choice of classic garden games on the front lawn, including croquet and giant pick-up sticks, just ask at reception.</p>
